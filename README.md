# Viccva Twitch Status Updater
A while back I created this little Rust program to hook up to Twitch, pull the stream data of a friend, and then save it in a .json file so that I could track his streams. It was intended as a replacement for a Python script that I had built for the same purpose as this one ran faster and used a third of the memory.
