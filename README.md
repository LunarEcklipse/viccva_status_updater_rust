# Viccva Twitch Status Updater
A while back I created this little Rust program to hook up to Twitch, pull the stream data of a friend, and then save it in a .json file so that I could track his streams. It was intended as a replacement for a Python script that I had built for the same purpose as this one ran faster and used a third of the memory.

I'd never really written code in Rust before, so this ended up serving as my first real foray into the subject matter. It was pretty fun, actually.
